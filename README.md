# C Shopping Cart Program

This is a command-line application written in C that handles basic retail calculations. It allows users to input an item name, its unit price, and the desired quantity to calculate a final total.

## Technical Implementation
The project demonstrates fundamental C programming concepts, including:
- String handling using `fgets` to allow for spaces in item names.
- Numerical input processing using `scanf`.
- Manual input buffer management to prevent stream skipping.
- String manipulation to remove trailing newline characters.

## How to Compile and Run
1. Ensure you have a C compiler (like GCC) installed.
2. Compile the source code:
   ```bash
   gcc main.c -o shopping_cart
3. Execute the program:
./shopping_cart
